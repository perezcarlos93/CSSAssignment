This CSS Homework includes several pages with various information.

The navbar has been kept the same throughout all html pages

The home page includes a quick welcome to the page as well as a rotating jumbotron. User's can return to the home page
at any time by clicking my icon in the top left of the navbar

The next page over is the "Contact me" page, where user's are given the option to submit their information and await a response
or email me directly. I did this just to practice implementing both methods

Next is the photo's page, where I take the opportunity to show some of my own photography, something that I enjoy doing
but am still trying to get good at. I included a few iterations of Bootstraps Card's and used the larger ones to highlight those particular photos. I also added a carousel for additional content. I also changed the opacity of the body so that my logo would be visible through the content. I included a secondary code to ensure that once the user hovers over the body, the images are no longer opaque. Each Card has a link to view the photo attached to it in its full size

The final page is the about me page, which includes another jumbotron as a header. Here, I utilized Bootstrap's accordion style drop down tabs to give more info about myself, what I currently do, and why I decided to learn coding
